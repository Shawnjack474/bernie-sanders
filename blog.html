            Bernard Sanders (born September 8, 1941)
             is an American politician who has served as the junior United States 
             Senator from Vermont since 2007. 
             The U.S. Representative for the state's at-large congressional 
             district from 1991 to 2007, he is the longest-serving independent
              in U.S. congressional history and a member of the Democratic caucus.
               He ran unsuccessfully for the 2016 Democratic nomination for
                president and is running again in 2020.

           <p> A progressive and self-described democratic socialist,
             Sanders is known for his opposition to economic inequality.
              On domestic policy, he broadly supports labor rights, and has 
              supported universal and single-payer healthcare, paid parental 
              leave, tuition-free tertiary education, and an ambitious Green 
              New Deal to create jobs addressing climate change. On foreign policy,
               he broadly supports reducing military spending,
                pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation, 
                and putting greater emphasis on labor rights and environmental
                 concerns when negotiating international trade agreements.
                  Commentators have variously described his political philosophy 
                  as aligned with New Deal policies and social democracy, 
                  but not necessarily with true socialism—characterized by the
                   social ownership of the means of production—and have noted
                    the strong influence his views have had on Democratic Party
                     politics since his 2016 presidential campaign.[2][3][4]

           <P> Sanders was born into a working-class Jewish family and raised 
            in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. He attended Brooklyn
             College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964.
              While a student, he was an active protest organizer for the Congress
               of Racial Equality as well as for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
                Committee during the civil rights movement. 
                After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful
                 third-party political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s.
                  As an independent, he was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981
                   and reelected three times. He won election to the U.S.
                    House of Representatives in 1990, representing Vermont's 
                    at-large congressional district; he later co-founded the
                     Congressional Progressive Caucus. He served as a U.S.
                      Representative for 16 years before being elected to the U.S.
                       Senate in 2006; he was reelected to the Senate in 2012 and 
                       2018.
            </p>
           <P> In April 2015, Sanders announced his campaign for the 2016 Democratic

             nomination for president of the United States. Despite initially low 
             expectations, he went on to win 23 primaries and caucuses and around 
             43% of pledged delegates, to Hillary Clinton's 55%. His campaign was
              noted for its supporters' enthusiasm, as well as for his rejection 
              of large donations from corporations, the financial industry,
               and any associated Super PAC. In July 2016, 
               he formally endorsed Clinton in her general election bid 
               against Republican Donald Trump, while urging his supporters to
                continue the "political revolution" his campaign had begun.
            
            In February 2019, Sanders announced a second presidential campaign,
             joining a large field of Democratic candidates pursuing the party
              nomination. This time, he entered the race as a formidable candidate
               with national recognition, along with a large base of small-dollar
                donors which has propelled his campaign's fundraising. 
                As of January 2020, Sanders had raised more money than any other 
                Democratic candidate, and only self-funded billionaires Tom Steyer
                 and Michael Bloomberg had more cash on hand.[5 ] 
                 In states that have voted in the primary, 
                 Sanders placed second in Iowa, losing narrowly 
                 to Pete Buttigieg, and won New Hampshire.
